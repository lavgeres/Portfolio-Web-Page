        <h3>About Louis</h3>
        <p>After high school I spent multiple years in the automotive industry and pursued an associates degree. I spent most my time working on and modifying my car as well as getting outside on some adventures with my dog.</p>
        <p>I started on my journey as a student at <strong><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a></strong> after being recommened to apply by a friend in the UX/UI program.</p>
        <p>I have always had an interest in the tech industry and have a love for creating something from scratch to a finished polished project. Software engineering combines my love for both and gives me an oppurtunity to continually push myself to become the best version of a developer as I can be while developing skills on my own as well through taking constructive criticism from peers or team members.</p>
